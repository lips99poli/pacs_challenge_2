- Documentation is clear and complete

- loss in computational time when matrix is compressed

- you should not leave a commented part of the tests in the main. Put it in a separate test file so that you can easily run it

- delete your personal comments when you push on the git repo
- choose one single language for the comments

- you could put the traits in the namespace algebra

- why static constexpr?
        because constexpr means that the variable you are defining is available at compile time, while in ia class the member variable

- you should have defined the friend operator* for a product between a matrix and a vector

- missing square root in the Frobenius norm
